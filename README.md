shortened workout logger but still not able to update scores.  can't use "scores" to tell AI to update input numbers (reps, weight, time).  Scores is identified as totals on a different supabase table

scores can now be updated 5/2/25

site.webmanifest was moved to root to replace the manifest.json

Okay, I will modify the components to use Supabase storage for profile and welcome page images. This involves updating the ProfileSettings.tsx and AdminSettings.tsx components to upload images to Supabase storage and store the URLs in the database.

I've updated the ProfileSettings.tsx and AdminSettings.tsx components to use Supabase storage for profile and welcome page images. I've also added a storage policy for avatars.
